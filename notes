2. To store any global variable(through out the project) define it under GlobalParams struct in GlobalParams.h and GlobalParams.cpp also.

3. This is intresting because we can store(for every cycle) the faults.
   - So we precompute the faults before each cycle(refer docs to do this, "something related to main function") and store it in GlobalParams.
   - This way we can have a Passive fault monitor as required by the d2-LBDR.

4. Use the ConfigManager.cpp to read the values from config file and store it in globalParams
